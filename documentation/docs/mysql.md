# MySQL

`XEST` framework uses `MySQL` within `Docker` which allows you to not to **install** the MySQL software.

When you start `Xest` framework, therefore the `Docker` it automatically forms your database, so that you don't have to do any extra work.

## Database Management Tools

Even though you do not need to download MySQL, in order to architech your database we suggest you download either [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) or [BeeKeeper Studio](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/get) database management softwares.

You can use either one of them to architect, develop, edit, update, delete, create, read, model, design your data from your databases.
