# Node/NPM

`Xest` framework uses `node` framework in the background which allows our Javascript code to run on our machine.

`XEST` framework uses `npm`which automatically is being downloaded when you install the `Xest` framework.

## Node Version Manager - NVM

We suggest that you use node version manager, [nvm](https://heynode.com/tutorial/install-nodejs-locally-nvm/), you can install and manage `node` packages with `nvm`. It would be handy to use `nvm` while using `Xest` framework.
